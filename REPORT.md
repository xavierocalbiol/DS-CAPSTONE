## 1. Introduction

Car accidents are one of the most common and most avoidable kinds of tragedies that we have to deal with on daily basis. Even though self-driving cars are a given, and most of these accidents occur because of the human factor, we can not rely on this promise in order to delay action to prevent these kinds of accidents. 

The target of this paper is focused on a very particular type of car crash in Seattle: "State Collision Code: 10- Entering at Angle". Reason behind this target is that historically is the 2ยบ most common type of accident and one that could be adressed with the proper usage of traffic lights, signs or technology. 

Those with power to adress this issue are the main audience of these work, and my final aim is to answer the question: "How precisely can we predict the chances of a car accident (Code 10) to be potentially harmful to the victims only given data that could be collected beforehand by Smart-City technology?"

Once an answer is given, the interested partys mainly Seattle Town Hall, will have better information on whether or not this is a profitable issue to amend.


## 2. DATA

Our data will be a specific subset of **Seattle Open Traffic Data** up to date. Only Code 10 (State Collision Code: 10- Entering at Angle) incidents will be analysed and only data that could be known by the city hall beforehand will be taken into account.
